# MSP-430G2553-ADC10-Temperature-Sensor-With-Single-Digit-Display-Assembly
This Assembly project uses the ADC10 Temperature Sensor on the MSP-430G2553 Microcontroller. The code updates the hexadecimal value of the temperature every second and outputs this on the 7-segment display. This is one of my several projects that I had to complete for my ECE-3362 Microcontrollers class at Texas Tech University. I received a 100% on the project and wanted to demonstrate how the temperature sensor on the MSP functions with the use of Assembly Code.

# Components Used:
1. Texas Instruments MSP430G2553 Microcontroller 
2. Mini USB-B Cable (Included with Microcontroller)
3. Custom 7-segment Launchpad Display 2.0 with 4 Pushbuttons provided by Texas Tech University
